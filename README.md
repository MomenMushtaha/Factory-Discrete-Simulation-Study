# Factory-Discrete-Simulation-Study

## Description
The 'Factory-Discrete-Simulation-Study' project is a simulation model designed to study and analyze factory operations using discrete event simulation techniques. This project aims to provide insights into the efficiency and performance of various manufacturing processes within a factory setting.

## Key Features
- **Discrete Event Simulation:** Models the operations and workflows in a factory environment using discrete event simulation.
- **Process Optimization:** Analyzes and optimizes manufacturing processes to improve efficiency and reduce bottlenecks.
- **Custom Scenarios:** Allows users to create custom factory scenarios by configuring parameters such as the number of machines, workers, and production rates.
- **Performance Metrics:** Provides detailed performance metrics and reports to evaluate the effectiveness of different strategies.
- **Visualization:** Offers a graphical representation of the factory layout and operations for better understanding and analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Simulation Library:** SimPy
- **Data Analysis:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
